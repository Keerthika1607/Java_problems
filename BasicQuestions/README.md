 - Range to find sum of numbers(12 to 15) - (num2*(num2+1)/2 - num1*(num1+1)/2 + num1) -> This is a formula.

 - ðŸ“Œ Letâ€™s take a number:
Suppose we want to check if n = 36 is prime.

We know:

36 = 1 Ã— 36

36 = 2 Ã— 18

36 = 3 Ã— 12

36 = 4 Ã— 9

36 = 6 Ã— 6

36 = 9 Ã— 4

36 = 12 Ã— 3

36 = 18 Ã— 2

36 = 36 Ã— 1

Look closely ðŸ‘€ â€” see how after 6 Ã— 6, the factors start repeating in reverse.

âœ¨ What is âˆšn?
âˆš36 = 6

After 6, all the factors are already checked (but in reverse).

So, if we donâ€™t find any factor up to âˆšn, it means:

There is no factor pair like a Ã— b = n
(where both a and b are greater than âˆšn)
â†’ Because if a > âˆšn, then b < âˆšn, so we already checked it!

âœ… Final Logic:
For any number n:

If n has a factor other than 1 and itself, then at least one of the factors must be â‰¤ âˆšn.

So, we only need to check from 2 to âˆšn.

If no number divides n in that range, then: ðŸ‘‰ n is prime!

ðŸ”¢ Example: Check if 29 is prime
âˆš29 â‰ˆ 5.38 â†’ check up to 5

Try dividing by 2, 3, 4, 5

None of them divide 29 â†’ So 29 is prime âœ…

 - In Armstrong Number -> int digits = String.valueOf(num).length();
   - String.valueOf(num) -> converts number to string value (876 -> "876").length() -> it finds the length of the digit so 3 will store in digits variable.
